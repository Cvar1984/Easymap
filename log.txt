| 
| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2006-0883] OpenSSH on FreeBSD 5.3 and 5.4, when used with OpenPAM, does not properly handle when a forked child process terminates during PAM authentication, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client connection refusal) by connecting multiple times to the SSH server, waiting for the password prompt, then disconnecting.
| [CVE-2012-0814] The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite.  NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.
| [CVE-2011-5000] The ssh_gssapi_parse_ename function in gss-serv.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, when gssapi-with-mic authentication is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large value in a certain length field.  NOTE: there may be limited scenarios in which this issue is relevant.
| [CVE-2011-0539] The key_certify function in usr.bin/ssh/key.c in OpenSSH 5.6 and 5.7, when generating legacy certificates using the -t command-line option in ssh-keygen, does not initialize the nonce field, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive stack memory contents or make it easier to conduct hash collision attacks.
| [CVE-2010-4755] The (1) remote_glob function in sftp-glob.c and the (2) process_put function in sftp.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, as used in FreeBSD 7.3 and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, OpenBSD 4.7, and other products, allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in SSH_FXP_STAT requests to an sftp daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
| [CVE-2010-4478] OpenSSH 5.6 and earlier, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol, a related issue to CVE-2010-4252.
| [CVE-2009-2904] A certain Red Hat modification to the ChrootDirectory feature in OpenSSH 4.8, as used in sshd in OpenSSH 4.3 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.4 and Fedora 11, allows local users to gain privileges via hard links to setuid programs that use configuration files within the chroot directory, related to requirements for directory ownership.
| [CVE-2008-3844] Certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5 packages for OpenSSH, as signed in August 2008 using a legitimate Red Hat GPG key, contain an externally introduced modification (Trojan Horse) that allows the package authors to have an unknown impact.  NOTE: since the malicious packages were not distributed from any official Red Hat sources, the scope of this issue is restricted to users who may have obtained these packages through unofficial distribution points.  As of 20080827, no unofficial distributions of this software are known.
| [CVE-2008-3259] OpenSSH before 5.1 sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option when the X11UseLocalhost configuration setting is disabled, which allows local users on some platforms to hijack the X11 forwarding port via a bind to a single IP address, as demonstrated on the HP-UX platform.

| [CVE-2003-0249] ** DISPUTED **  PHP treats unknown methods such as "PoSt" as a GET request, which could allow attackers to intended access restrictions if PHP is running on a server that passes on all methods, such as Apache httpd 2.0, as demonstrated using a Limit directive.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying "It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method.  A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods.  It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report."

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-4211] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.0.3 allows remote authenticated users with the insert right to save certain flags via a (1) COPY or (2) APPEND command.
| [CVE-2007-2231] Directory traversal vulnerability in index/mbox/mbox-storage.c in Dovecot before 1.0.rc29, when using the zlib plugin, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary gzipped (.gz) mailboxes (mbox files) via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the mailbox name.
| [CVE-2007-2173] Eval injection vulnerability in (1) courier-imapd.indirect and (2) courier-pop3d.indirect in Courier-IMAP before 4.0.6-r2, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2-r1, on Gentoo Linux allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the XMAILDIR variable, related to the LOGINRUN variable.
| [CVE-2007-0618] Unspecified vulnerability in (1) pop3d, (2) pop3ds, (3) imapd, and (4) imapds in IBM AIX 5.3.0 has unspecified impact and attack vectors, involving an "authentication vulnerability."
| [CVE-2006-5973] Off-by-one buffer overflow in Dovecot 1.0test53 through 1.0.rc14, and possibly other versions, when index files are used and mmap_disable is set to "yes," allows remote authenticated IMAP or POP3 users to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors involving the cache file.
| [CVE-2006-2502] Stack-based buffer overflow in pop3d in Cyrus IMAPD (cyrus-imapd) 2.3.2, when the popsubfolders option is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long USER command.
| [CVE-2006-2414] Directory traversal vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0 beta and 1.0 allows remote attackers to list files and directories under the mbox parent directory and obtain mailbox names via ".." sequences in the (1) LIST or (2) DELETE IMAP command.
| [CVE-2006-0730] Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Dovecot before 1.0beta3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash or hang) via unspecified vectors involving (1) "potential hangs" in the APPEND command and "potential crashes" in (2) dovecot-auth and (3) imap/pop3-login.  NOTE: vector 2 might be related to a double free vulnerability.
| [CVE-2002-0925] Format string vulnerability in mmsyslog function allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) the USER command to mmpop3d for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, (2) the HELO command to mmsmtpd for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, or (3) the USER command to mmftpd 0.0.7 and earlier.
| [CVE-2001-0143] vpop3d program in linuxconf 1.23r and earlier allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2000-1197] POP2 or POP3 server (pop3d) in imap-uw IMAP package on FreeBSD and other operating systems creates lock files with predictable names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (lack of mail access) for other users by creating lock files for other mail boxes.
| [CVE-1999-1445] Vulnerability in imapd and ipop3d in Slackware 3.4 and 3.3 with shadowing enabled, and possibly other operating systems, allows remote attackers to cause a core dump via a short sequence of USER and PASS commands that do not provide valid usernames or passwords.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-3481] The index_get_ids function in index.c in imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server before 2.4.11, when server-side threading is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted References header in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2011-3372] imap/nntpd.c in the NNTP server (nntpd) for Cyrus IMAPd 2.4.x before 2.4.12 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by sending an AUTHINFO USER command without sending an additional AUTHINFO PASS command.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-5740] The format string protection mechanism in IMAPD for Perdition Mail Retrieval Proxy 1.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an IMAP tag with a null byte followed by a format string specifier, which is not counted by the mechanism.
| [CVE-2007-5018] Stack-based buffer overflow in IMAPD in Mercury/32 4.52 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a long argument in a SEARCH ON command.  NOTE: this issue might overlap with CVE-2004-1211.

| [CVE-2007-2231] Directory traversal vulnerability in index/mbox/mbox-storage.c in Dovecot before 1.0.rc29, when using the zlib plugin, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary gzipped (.gz) mailboxes (mbox files) via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the mailbox name.
| [CVE-2007-2173] Eval injection vulnerability in (1) courier-imapd.indirect and (2) courier-pop3d.indirect in Courier-IMAP before 4.0.6-r2, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2-r1, on Gentoo Linux allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the XMAILDIR variable, related to the LOGINRUN variable.
| [CVE-2007-1579] Stack-based buffer overflow in Atrium MERCUR IMAPD allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a certain SUBSCRIBE command.
| [CVE-2007-1578] Multiple integer signedness errors in the NTLM implementation in Atrium MERCUR IMAPD (mcrimap4.exe) 5.00.14, with SP4, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long NTLMSSP argument that triggers a stack-based buffer overflow.
| [CVE-2007-0618] Unspecified vulnerability in (1) pop3d, (2) pop3ds, (3) imapd, and (4) imapds in IBM AIX 5.3.0 has unspecified impact and attack vectors, involving an "authentication vulnerability."
| [CVE-2006-6762] The IMAP daemon (IMAPD) in Novell NetMail before 3.52e FTF2 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service via an APPEND command with a single "(" (parenthesis) in the argument.

| [CVE-2006-5973] Off-by-one buffer overflow in Dovecot 1.0test53 through 1.0.rc14, and possibly other versions, when index files are used and mmap_disable is set to "yes," allows remote authenticated IMAP or POP3 users to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors involving the cache file.
| [CVE-2006-2502] Stack-based buffer overflow in pop3d in Cyrus IMAPD (cyrus-imapd) 2.3.2, when the popsubfolders option is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long USER command.
| [CVE-2006-2414] Directory traversal vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0 beta and 1.0 allows remote attackers to list files and directories under the mbox parent directory and obtain mailbox names via ".." sequences in the (1) LIST or (2) DELETE IMAP command.
| [CVE-2006-0730] Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Dovecot before 1.0beta3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash or hang) via unspecified vectors involving (1) "potential hangs" in the APPEND command and "potential crashes" in (2) dovecot-auth and (3) imap/pop3-login.  NOTE: vector 2 might be related to a double free vulnerability.
| [CVE-2005-2278] Stack-based buffer overflow in the IMAP daemon (imapd) in MailEnable Professional 1.54 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via the status command with a long mailbox name.
| [CVE-2005-1256] Stack-based buffer overflow in the IMAP daemon (IMAPD32.EXE) in IMail 8.13 in Ipswitch Collaboration Suite (ICS), and other versions before IMail Server 8.2 Hotfix 2, allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a STATUS command with a long mailbox name.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-4156] Apache OpenOffice.org (OOo) before 4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted element in an OOXML document file.
| [CVE-2013-4131] The mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module in Subversion 1.7.0 through 1.7.10 and 1.8.x before 1.8.1 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (assertion failure or out-of-bounds read) via a certain (1) COPY, (2) DELETE, or (3) MOVE request against a revision root.
| [CVE-2013-3239] phpMyAdmin 3.5.x before 3.5.8 and 4.x before 4.0.0-rc3, when a SaveDir directory is configured, allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by using a double extension in the filename of an export file, leading to interpretation of this file as an executable file by the Apache HTTP Server, as demonstrated by a .php.sql filename.
| [CVE-2013-3060] The web console in Apache ActiveMQ before 5.8.0 does not require authentication, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service via HTTP requests.
| [CVE-2013-2765] The ModSecurity module before 2.7.4 for the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference, process crash, and disk consumption) via a POST request with a large body and a crafted Content-Type header.
| [CVE-2013-2251] Apache Struts 2.0.0 through 2.3.15 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL expressions via a parameter with a crafted (1) action:, (2) redirect:, or (3) redirectAction: prefix.
| [CVE-2013-2249] mod_session_dbd.c in the mod_session_dbd module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.5 proceeds with save operations for a session without considering the dirty flag and the requirement for a new session ID, which has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors.
| [CVE-2013-2248] Multiple open redirect vulnerabilities in Apache Struts 2.0.0 through 2.3.15 allow remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL in a parameter using the (1) redirect: or (2) redirectAction: prefix.
| [CVE-2013-2189] Apache OpenOffice.org (OOo) before 4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via invalid PLCF data in a DOC document file.
| [CVE-2013-2135] Apache Struts 2 before 2.3.14.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL code via a request with a crafted value that contains both "${}" and "%{}" sequences, which causes the OGNL code to be evaluated twice.
| [CVE-2013-2134] Apache Struts 2 before 2.3.14.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL code via a request with a crafted action name that is not properly handled during wildcard matching, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-2135.
| [CVE-2013-2115] Apache Struts 2 before 2.3.14.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL code via a crafted request that is not properly handled when using the includeParams attribute in the (1) URL or (2) A tag. NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-1966.
| [CVE-2013-2071] java/org/apache/catalina/core/AsyncContextImpl.java in Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.40 does not properly handle the throwing of a RuntimeException in an AsyncListener in an application, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive request information intended for other applications in opportunistic circumstances via an application that records the requests that it processes.

| [CVE-2001-0131] htpasswd and htdigest in Apache 2.0a9, 1.3.14, and others allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2001-0108] PHP Apache module 4.0.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass .htaccess access restrictions via a malformed HTTP request on an unrestricted page that causes PHP to use those access controls on the next page that is requested.
| [CVE-2001-0042] PHP 3.x (PHP3) on Apache 1.3.6 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a modified .. (dot dot) attack containing "%5c" (encoded backslash) sequences.
| [CVE-2000-1247] The default configuration of the jserv-status handler in jserv.conf in Apache JServ 1.1.2 includes an "allow from 127.0.0.1" line, which allows local users to discover JDBC passwords or other sensitive information via a direct request to the jserv/ URI.
| [CVE-2000-1210] Directory traversal vulnerability in source.jsp of Apache Tomcat before 3.1 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the argument to source.jsp.
| [CVE-2000-1206] Vulnerability in Apache httpd before 1.3.11, when configured for mass virtual hosting using mod_rewrite, or mod_vhost_alias in Apache 1.3.9, allows remote attackers to retrieve arbitrary files.
| [CVE-2000-1205] Cross site scripting vulnerabilities in Apache 1.3.0 through 1.3.11 allow remote attackers to execute script as other web site visitors via (1) the printenv CGI (printenv.pl), which does not encode its output, (2) pages generated by the ap_send_error_response function such as a default 404, which does not add an explicit charset, or (3) various messages that are generated by certain Apache modules or core code.  NOTE: the printenv issue might still exist for web browsers that can render text/plain content types as HTML, such as Internet Explorer, but CVE regards this as a design limitation of those browsers, not Apache.  The printenv.pl/acuparam vector, discloser on 20070724, is one such variant.
| [CVE-2000-1204] Vulnerability in the mod_vhost_alias virtual hosting module for Apache 1.3.9, 1.3.11 and 1.3.12 allows remote attackers to obtain the source code for CGI programs if the cgi-bin directory is under the document root.
| [CVE-2000-1168] IBM HTTP Server 1.3.6 (based on Apache) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary commands via a long GET request.
| [CVE-2000-1016] The default configuration of Apache (httpd.conf) on SuSE 6.4 includes an alias for the /usr/doc directory, which allows remote attackers to read package documentation and obtain system configuration information via an HTTP request for the /doc/packages URL.
| [CVE-2000-0913] mod_rewrite in Apache 1.3.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files if a RewriteRule directive is expanded to include a filename whose name contains a regular expression.
| [CVE-2000-0883] The default configuration of mod_perl for Apache as installed on Mandrake Linux 6.1 through 7.1 sets the /perl/ directory to be browseable, which allows remote attackers to list the contents of that directory.
| [CVE-2000-0869] The default configuration of Apache 1.3.12 in SuSE Linux 6.4 enables WebDAV, which allows remote attackers to list arbitrary diretories via the PROPFIND HTTP request method.
| [CVE-2000-0868] The default configuration of Apache 1.3.12 in SuSE Linux 6.4 allows remote attackers to read source code for CGI scripts by replacing the /cgi-bin/ in the requested URL with /cgi-bin-sdb/.
| [CVE-2000-0791] Trustix installs the httpsd program for Apache-SSL with world-writeable permissions, which allows local users to replace it with a Trojan horse.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2012-5671] Heap-based buffer overflow in the dkim_exim_query_dns_txt function in dkim.c in Exim 4.70 through 4.80, when DKIM support is enabled and acl_smtp_connect and acl_smtp_rcpt are not set to "warn control = dkim_disable_verify," allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an email from a malicious DNS server.
| [CVE-2012-0478] The texImage2D implementation in the WebGL subsystem in Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 11.0, Firefox ESR 10.x before 10.0.4, Thunderbird 5.0 through 11.0, Thunderbird ESR 10.x before 10.0.4, and SeaMonkey before 2.9 does not properly restrict JSVAL_TO_OBJECT casts, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web page.
| [CVE-2011-1764] Format string vulnerability in the dkim_exim_verify_finish function in src/dkim.c in Exim before 4.76 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via format string specifiers in data used in DKIM logging, as demonstrated by an identity field containing a % (percent) character.
| [CVE-2011-1407] The DKIM implementation in Exim 4.7x before 4.76 permits matching for DKIM identities to apply to lookup items, instead of only strings, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or access a filesystem via a crafted identity.
| [CVE-2011-0017] The open_log function in log.c in Exim 4.72 and earlier does not check the return value from (1) setuid or (2) setgid system calls, which allows local users to append log data to arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2010-4345] Exim 4.72 and earlier allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging the ability of the exim user account to specify an alternate configuration file with a directive that contains arbitrary commands, as demonstrated by the spool_directory directive.
| [CVE-2010-4344] Heap-based buffer overflow in the string_vformat function in string.c in Exim before 4.70 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an SMTP session that includes two MAIL commands in conjunction with a large message containing crafted headers, leading to improper rejection logging.
| [CVE-2010-2024] transports/appendfile.c in Exim before 4.72, when MBX locking is enabled, allows local users to change permissions of arbitrary files or create arbitrary files, and cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges, via a symlink attack on a lockfile in /tmp/.
| [CVE-2010-2023] transports/appendfile.c in Exim before 4.72, when a world-writable sticky-bit mail directory is used, does not verify the st_nlink field of mailbox files, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges by creating a hard link to another user's file.
| [CVE-2006-1251] Argument injection vulnerability in greylistclean.cron in sa-exim 4.2 allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files via an email with a To field that contains a filename separated by whitespace, which is not quoted when greylistclean.cron provides the argument to the rm command.
| [CVE-2005-0022] Buffer overflow in the spa_base64_to_bits function in Exim before 4.43, as originally obtained from Samba code, and as called by the auth_spa_client function, may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code during SPA authentication.
| [CVE-2005-0021] Multiple buffer overflows in Exim before 4.43 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) an IPv6 address with more than 8 components, as demonstrated using the -be command line option, which triggers an overflow in the host_aton function, or (2) the -bh command line option or dnsdb PTR lookup, which triggers an overflow in the dns_build_reverse function.
| [CVE-2004-0400] Stack-based buffer overflow in Exim 4 before 4.33, when the headers_check_syntax option is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code during the header check.
| [CVE-2004-0399] Stack-based buffer overflow in Exim 3.35, and other versions before 4, when the sender_verify option is true, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code during sender verification.
| [CVE-2003-0743] Heap-based buffer overflow in smtp_in.c for Exim 3 (exim3) before 3.36 and Exim 4 (exim4) before 4.21 may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an invalid (1) HELO or (2) EHLO argument with a large number of spaces followed by a NULL character and a newline, which is not properly trimmed before the "(no argument given)" string is appended to the buffer.
| [CVE-2002-1381] Format string vulnerability in daemon.c for Exim 4.x through 4.10, and 3.x through 3.36, allows exim administrative users to execute arbitrary code by modifying the pid_file_path value.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2012-5671] Heap-based buffer overflow in the dkim_exim_query_dns_txt function in dkim.c in Exim 4.70 through 4.80, when DKIM support is enabled and acl_smtp_connect and acl_smtp_rcpt are not set to "warn control = dkim_disable_verify," allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an email from a malicious DNS server.
| [CVE-2012-0478] The texImage2D implementation in the WebGL subsystem in Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 11.0, Firefox ESR 10.x before 10.0.4, Thunderbird 5.0 through 11.0, Thunderbird ESR 10.x before 10.0.4, and SeaMonkey before 2.9 does not properly restrict JSVAL_TO_OBJECT casts, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web page.
| [CVE-2011-1764] Format string vulnerability in the dkim_exim_verify_finish function in src/dkim.c in Exim before 4.76 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via format string specifiers in data used in DKIM logging, as demonstrated by an identity field containing a % (percent) character.
| [CVE-2011-1407] The DKIM implementation in Exim 4.7x before 4.76 permits matching for DKIM identities to apply to lookup items, instead of only strings, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or access a filesystem via a crafted identity.
| [CVE-2011-0017] The open_log function in log.c in Exim 4.72 and earlier does not check the return value from (1) setuid or (2) setgid system calls, which allows local users to append log data to arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2010-4345] Exim 4.72 and earlier allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging the ability of the exim user account to specify an alternate configuration file with a directive that contains arbitrary commands, as demonstrated by the spool_directory directive.
| [CVE-2010-4344] Heap-based buffer overflow in the string_vformat function in string.c in Exim before 4.70 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an SMTP session that includes two MAIL commands in conjunction with a large message containing crafted headers, leading to improper rejection logging.
| [CVE-2010-2024] transports/appendfile.c in Exim before 4.72, when MBX locking is enabled, allows local users to change permissions of arbitrary files or create arbitrary files, and cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges, via a symlink attack on a lockfile in /tmp/.
| [CVE-2010-2023] transports/appendfile.c in Exim before 4.72, when a world-writable sticky-bit mail directory is used, does not verify the st_nlink field of mailbox files, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges by creating a hard link to another user's file.
| [CVE-2006-1251] Argument injection vulnerability in greylistclean.cron in sa-exim 4.2 allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files via an email with a To field that contains a filename separated by whitespace, which is not quoted when greylistclean.cron provides the argument to the rm command.
| [CVE-2005-0022] Buffer overflow in the spa_base64_to_bits function in Exim before 4.43, as originally obtained from Samba code, and as called by the auth_spa_client function, may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code during SPA authentication.
| [CVE-2005-0021] Multiple buffer overflows in Exim before 4.43 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) an IPv6 address with more than 8 components, as demonstrated using the -be command line option, which triggers an overflow in the host_aton function, or (2) the -bh command line option or dnsdb PTR lookup, which triggers an overflow in the dns_build_reverse function.
| [CVE-2004-0400] Stack-based buffer overflow in Exim 4 before 4.33, when the headers_check_syntax option is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code during the header check.
| [CVE-2004-0399] Stack-based buffer overflow in Exim 3.35, and other versions before 4, when the sender_verify option is true, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code during sender verification.
| [CVE-2003-0743] Heap-based buffer overflow in smtp_in.c for Exim 3 (exim3) before 3.36 and Exim 4 (exim4) before 4.21 may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an invalid (1) HELO or (2) EHLO argument with a large number of spaces followed by a NULL character and a newline, which is not properly trimmed before the "(no argument given)" string is appended to the buffer.
| [CVE-2002-1381] Format string vulnerability in daemon.c for Exim 4.x through 4.10, and 3.x through 3.36, allows exim administrative users to execute arbitrary code by modifying the pid_file_path value.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-3481] The index_get_ids function in index.c in imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server before 2.4.11, when server-side threading is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted References header in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2011-3372] imap/nntpd.c in the NNTP server (nntpd) for Cyrus IMAPd 2.4.x before 2.4.12 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by sending an AUTHINFO USER command without sending an additional AUTHINFO PASS command.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-4211] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.0.3 allows remote authenticated users with the insert right to save certain flags via a (1) COPY or (2) APPEND command.
| [CVE-2007-2231] Directory traversal vulnerability in index/mbox/mbox-storage.c in Dovecot before 1.0.rc29, when using the zlib plugin, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary gzipped (.gz) mailboxes (mbox files) via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the mailbox name.
| [CVE-2007-2173] Eval injection vulnerability in (1) courier-imapd.indirect and (2) courier-pop3d.indirect in Courier-IMAP before 4.0.6-r2, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2-r1, on Gentoo Linux allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the XMAILDIR variable, related to the LOGINRUN variable.
| [CVE-2007-0618] Unspecified vulnerability in (1) pop3d, (2) pop3ds, (3) imapd, and (4) imapds in IBM AIX 5.3.0 has unspecified impact and attack vectors, involving an "authentication vulnerability."
| [CVE-2006-5973] Off-by-one buffer overflow in Dovecot 1.0test53 through 1.0.rc14, and possibly other versions, when index files are used and mmap_disable is set to "yes," allows remote authenticated IMAP or POP3 users to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors involving the cache file.
| [CVE-2006-2502] Stack-based buffer overflow in pop3d in Cyrus IMAPD (cyrus-imapd) 2.3.2, when the popsubfolders option is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long USER command.
| [CVE-2006-2414] Directory traversal vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0 beta and 1.0 allows remote attackers to list files and directories under the mbox parent directory and obtain mailbox names via ".." sequences in the (1) LIST or (2) DELETE IMAP command.
| [CVE-2006-0730] Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Dovecot before 1.0beta3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash or hang) via unspecified vectors involving (1) "potential hangs" in the APPEND command and "potential crashes" in (2) dovecot-auth and (3) imap/pop3-login.  NOTE: vector 2 might be related to a double free vulnerability.
| [CVE-2002-0925] Format string vulnerability in mmsyslog function allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) the USER command to mmpop3d for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, (2) the HELO command to mmsmtpd for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, or (3) the USER command to mmftpd 0.0.7 and earlier.
| [CVE-2001-0143] vpop3d program in linuxconf 1.23r and earlier allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2000-1197] POP2 or POP3 server (pop3d) in imap-uw IMAP package on FreeBSD and other operating systems creates lock files with predictable names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (lack of mail access) for other users by creating lock files for other mail boxes.
| [CVE-1999-1445] Vulnerability in imapd and ipop3d in Slackware 3.4 and 3.3 with shadowing enabled, and possibly other operating systems, allows remote attackers to cause a core dump via a short sequence of USER and PASS commands that do not provide valid usernames or passwords.

| [CVE-2002-1923] The default configuration in MySQL 3.20.32 through 3.23.52, when running on Windows, does not have logging enabled, which could allow remote attackers to conduct activities without detection.
| [CVE-2002-1921] The default configuration of MySQL 3.20.32 through 3.23.52, when running on Windows, does set the bind address to the loopback interface, which allows remote attackers to connect to the database.
| [CVE-2002-1809] The default configuration of the Windows binary release of MySQL 3.23.2 through 3.23.52 has a NULL root password, which could allow remote attackers to gain unauthorized root access to the MySQL database.
| [CVE-2002-1479] Cacti before 0.6.8 stores a MySQL username and password in plaintext in config.php, which has world-readable permissions, which allows local users modify databases as the Cacti user and possibly gain privileges.
| [CVE-2002-1376] libmysqlclient client library in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.54, and 4.x to 4.0.6, does not properly verify length fields for certain responses in the (1) read_rows or (2) read_one_row routines, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.
| [CVE-2002-1375] The COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x before 3.23.54, and 4.x to 4.0.6, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long response.
| [CVE-2002-1374] The COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x before 3.23.54, and 4.x before 4.0.6, allows remote attackers to gain privileges via a brute force attack using a one-character password, which causes MySQL to only compare the provided password against the first character of the real password.
| [CVE-2002-1373] Signed integer vulnerability in the COM_TABLE_DUMP package for MySQL 3.23.x before 3.23.54 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or hang) in mysqld by causing large negative integers to be provided to a memcpy call.
| [CVE-2002-0969] Buffer overflow in MySQL daemon (mysqld) before 3.23.50, and 4.0 beta before 4.02, on the Win32 platform, allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long "datadir" parameter in the my.ini initialization file, whose permissions on Windows allow Full Control to the Everyone group.
| [CVE-2002-0229] Safe Mode feature (safe_mode) in PHP 3.0 through 4.1.0 allows attackers with access to the MySQL database to bypass Safe Mode access restrictions and read arbitrary files using "LOAD DATA INFILE LOCAL" SQL statements.
| [CVE-2001-1454] Buffer overflow in MySQL before 3.23.33 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long drop database request.
| [CVE-2001-1453] Buffer overflow in libmysqlclient.so in MySQL 3.23.33 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long host parameter.
| [CVE-2001-1275] MySQL before 3.23.31 allows users with a MySQL account to use the SHOW GRANTS command to obtain the encrypted administrator password from the mysql.user table and possibly gain privileges via password cracking.
| [CVE-2001-1274] Buffer overflow in MySQL before 3.23.31 allows attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly gain privileges.
| [CVE-2001-1255] WinMySQLadmin 1.1 stores the MySQL password in plain text in the my.ini file, which allows local users to obtain unathorized access the MySQL database.
| [CVE-2001-1226] AdCycle 1.17 and earlier allow remote attackers to modify SQL queries, which are not properly sanitized before being passed to the MySQL database.
| [CVE-2001-1044] Basilix Webmail 0.9.7beta, and possibly other versions, stores *.class and *.inc files under the document root and does not restrict access, which could allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information such as MySQL passwords and usernames from the mysql.class file.
| [CVE-2001-0990] Inter7 vpopmail 4.10.35 and earlier, when using the MySQL module, compiles authentication information in cleartext into the libvpopmail.a library, which allows local users to obtain the MySQL username and password by inspecting the vpopmail programs that use the library.
| [CVE-2001-0645] Symantec/AXENT NetProwler 3.5.x contains several default passwords, which could allow remote attackers to (1) access to the management tier via the "admin" password, or (2) connect to a MySQL ODBC from the management tier using a blank password.
| [CVE-2001-0407] Directory traversal vulnerability in MySQL before 3.23.36 allows local users to modify arbitrary files and gain privileges by creating a database whose name starts with .. (dot dot).
| [CVE-2000-0981] MySQL Database Engine uses a weak authentication method which leaks information that could be used by a remote attacker to recover the password.
| [CVE-2000-0957] The pluggable authentication module for mysql (pam_mysql) before 0.4.7 does not properly cleanse user input when constructing SQL statements, which allows attackers to obtain plaintext passwords or hashes.
| [CVE-2000-0707] PCCS MySQLDatabase Admin Tool Manager 1.2.4 and earlier installs the file dbconnect.inc within the web root, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information such as the administrative password.
| [CVE-2000-0148] MySQL 3.22 allows remote attackers to bypass password authentication and access a database via a short check string.
| [CVE-2000-0045] MySQL allows local users to modify passwords for arbitrary MySQL users via the GRANT privilege.
| [CVE-1999-1188] mysqld in MySQL 3.21 creates log files with world-readable permissions, which allows local users to obtain passwords for users who are added to the user database.
